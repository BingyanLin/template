			<p>Those actions mentioned above should be used to solve the social issue. It will be hard to change people’s value of money which has been accepted by almost everyone in the world, but building the correct value is the most important step to take to solve this problem. The whole society and government should attatch great importance on this problem and take measures as soon as possible, especially from the education of the students, because they will become the most important part of our society in the future.

In conclusion, money is not that important when compare to love, happiness, knowledge , time and things that cannot be bought. People should live for their dream, not just money. With a correct value of money, we will find out the things we like and the life we want. Everyone should make one’s best efforts to make their dream come true.
