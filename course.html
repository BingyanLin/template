			<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
			<p>WRA110 helped me a lot in writing skills since the four projects we did in this semester are all different and we learned to use various ways to express literacy through those projects. I had section 744 this semester which mostly write about science and technology. The theme of this course is writing in the digital age. Therefore, we are not only doing the writing part in this course, but also learning to make html website using codecademy and github.</p>
		    <p>On the whole, this class is pretty interesting and has a lot of challenges waiting for you. You will find yourself learning progresses while keep pace with the class assignment and finish your projects. You will enjoy your success after you set up your own website.  Our section of WRA 110 focuses on the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that successfully enhance writing, reading, and researching in higher education in America. Specifically, we will be looking at issues and concepts dealing with digital technology and visual rhetoric to think about what we know about literacy, how we know what we know, and how we can engage and enhance our illiteracies through deep explorations of what things mean. This course is a part of general education requirement which develops your skills, knowledge, and attitudes that improve the quality of life for self and others through scholarly, social, and professional activities. </p>
			<p>The first major assignment in this course is lived experiences project which requires you to create a narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology has impacted your choice of a major/career at the present time. You will present this narrative in two forms: an electronic written document and a version for the web. In order to complete this report, first you need to identify an academic and/or professional career track for yourself, and you need to identify and describe one piece of technology that has led you to your chosen field. This assignment should be at least 1,200 words in length and include a description of your chosen academic/career path, a description of your technical object, and depictions of relevant personal experiences linking your technical object to your academic/career path. For this lived experience project, I wrote my own story about my childhood. My mom was a math teacher in elementary school. She began to teach me the numbers and some calculate before I went to school. So it was not surprising that I did well in math, and my math teacher very liked me. However, actually, I was not really interested in math until I got an abacus from my mom. At that time, we cannot use a calculator in school so this abacus became to a helpful tool for me to deal with math problems. It was a brown abacus in a rectangular shape; it was kind of old and big to me, but I just felt I like it. At first, I had no idea how to use it, but I liked to play with the little balls on it. My mom told me it was a gift which my grandmother bought to her when my mom got her first job. In China, it is a traditional tool which can be used to calculate. We called it “suan pan”. It is quite convenient and makes the calculate simple to do. Just move some balls and the answer will come up clearly. After my mom taught me how to use it, I showed it to some of my friends, and I found myself was attracted to math. I loved to calculate. Abacus was the first piece of technology that led me to choose accounting major. This assignment is the easiest one compared to other projects we did later. By writing this article, I have learned a better way to write narrative and made my article more impressive by revise it a few times and read the comment from other students on Eli review. In addition, I have got a better awareness of my career plan when I was thinking about this assignment.</p>
			<p>The second project is cultural analysis proposal. This time you need to learn to write formal proposal which is a significant type of document in the technical workplace.  This assignment asks you, through the analysis of a cultural artifact, to investigate a specific social issue and its import on society. For this project, you will select an artifact of popular culture and explain how that artifact illustrates or depicts either a group of people or your social issue. And you also need to provide a thoughtful analysis of what your artifact contributes to the discussion of your social issue.  Finally, you will propose a solution that helps or possibly solves the social issue in question. In order to be complete, your report should include an executive summary, background analysis (analysis of the artifact), description of the issue, proposed solution, anticipated results/effects, and conclusion. Additionally, your finished report must adhere strictly to the conventions of either MLA or APA format and be 1,800 - 2,100 words in length. The purpose of my cultural analysis proposal is to discuss the theme and impact of the novel The Great Gatsby which is a story about the thwarted love between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan. The Great Gatsby reveals the disintegration of the American dream in the era of prosperity and material and it also draws people’s attention on the relationship between money and love. With the rapid development of commodity economy, people’s awareness of money are gradually strengthened.  We have seen a lot of examples in our life. Social relations between people show the relationship between money more and more specifically and directly. Is this phenomenon a kind of progress in the field of social consciousness, or a step of Retrogression? How can we solve this social issue? In my opinion, the problem about money in our society needs to be solved by both government and citizens. Firstly, the government should control the price and ensure housing affordability and housing price stability. It is the government’s responsibility and obligation to provide houses to citizens, not the way to make money. Secondly, education plays an important role to change people’s idea about money. There are two ways to solve this social issue in education. The first one is that we should require a course in school to help students to set up the correct values of money. We can also set up some presentations for the students and ask them to do some survey about the values of money, in this way, we can correct their opinions and change people’s mind little by little. Thirdly, the society should appeal for charity. In this way, wealthy people will make generous response to the appeals for funds. And money will be used on the people who need help and things that deserved to use more money on. It is not only a good way to narrow the gap between the rich and poor, but also a way to change people’s opinion of wealth. The rich people are willing to donate money to charity because it shows their kindness. If the movie stars begin to get involved in the charity, the media will report and praise this kind of behavior, and it will cause a big social effect. Those actions mentioned above should be used to solve the social issue. It will be hard to change people’s value of money which has been accepted by almost everyone in the world, but building the correct value is the most important step to take to solve this problem. In conclusion, money is not that important when compare to love, happiness, knowledge , time and things that cannot be bought. People should live for their dream, not just money. With a correct value of money, we will find out the things we like and the life we want. Everyone should make one’s best efforts to make their dream come true.</p>
			<p>The third one is formal research report which let you to build your own understanding of how writing, reading, and researching operate within a discipline of interest to you. 
This assignment allows you to continue engaging effective invention, arrangement, revision, style, and delivery practices. It also introduces you to the ways that research and participating in important academic discussions prepare you to use literacy in successful ways across the kinds of writing situations you will find yourself in in higher education and, perhaps, beyond. Many students come to higher education with only a vague idea of what it means to become a participating member of an academic discipline. Your purpose in this essay is to give students who are new to the academic discipline/field you have chosen an introduction to the expectations for writing, reading, and researching in that discipline. Ultimately, your paper should help your audience understand the ways that literacy are used to create and communicate knowledge in the discipline/field you choose to explore. For this proposal, I wrote about business field. Business plays a big role in the economy of our society today in creating job opportunities for the people hence reducing poverty. Business also boosts the society in economy and strong manufacturing and service sectors. As a result, college students who major in business field need to acquire the knowledge of business. Nowadays, many students are confused about their majors as they become a participating member of an academic discipline. As a result, the purpose of my formal research report is to give the students who are new to the business field an introduction of specific application of business in our society and what are we going to learn among the courses. One important thing that have to be mentioned is the ways that literacy is used to creat and communicate knowledge in the business field. As is known to all, literacy is a fundamental skill that we have to master to deal with stuffs in our life, the same as in business field. There are three things that are vital important for business discipline. They are writing, reading, and researching. Writing is the most significant skill of communication. It is one of the most important transferable skills that workers possess. Reading is a significant part in business as well, especially in the leadership ability. Research is another important role in business decision. When we are dealing with the marketing and management, planning, evaluating and interpreting research are vital skills that we need to master. 
</p>
			<p>And the last one is multimedia remix project which requires group works and make a documentary with your group. This is the hardest project in this semester since it requires you to choose one earlier project and express the theme in a totally different way. Our group decided to use one of our group member’s cultural analysis proposal which talks about the importance of taking risks in our life. Therefore, our documentary has a main issue that the advantages of taking risks far outweigh the disadvantages. In order to prove this point, we collected a lot of examples of the risk takers who have won the success ultimately. In our final documentary, each group member states a point of view and gives an example of the successful story of celebrity who faced the challenges and took risks and achieved the goal at last, which will help the audience to better understand the significance of taking risks. Therefore, our documentary is composed of the main idea and three examples. In this way, we will understand better that life is full of adventure and challenges, only if you dare to take risks can you get the success. </p>
		    <p>Overall, WRA110 not only taught you how to write, it also make you think about your major and career. Throughout the four project you will find yourself making big progress in writing and improve your ability in individual work and group work. </p>
