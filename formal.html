			<h1> Formal Research Report </h1>
			<p>When it comes to the issue about economy, the first word we will think of is business. Business plays a big role in the economy of our society today in creating job opportunities for the people hence reducing poverty. Business also boosts the society in economy and strong manufacturing and service sectors. Not only for the society, business takes part in our daily life as well. We need to know how business works to manage our personal finance. As a result, college students who major in business field need to acquire the knowledge of business. In our college, business is a broad discipline which consists of accounting, finance and budgeting, sales and marketing, financial reporting, taxation, and some other branches. There is an increasing number of students trying hard to attend the business college every year which results in the fierce competition among the students who are coming to higher education in business college. Nowadays, many students are confused about their majors as they become a participating member of an academic discipline. As a result, the purpose of my formal research report is to give the students who are new to the business field an introduction of specific application of business in our society and what are we going to learn among the courses.

</p>
<p>Some students might still feel confused about the definition of business. A business can be defined as an organization or economic system where goods and services are exchanged for one another or for money. Business can be profitable and non-profitable. Most commercial behavior gain brofit by selling goods or services to make money, such as Microsoft, SONY, IBM, lenovo, and other typical representative business organizations. Some other certain business practices, however, is only for providing the basic fund to the operational business, generally this kind of business is called the business practices of nonprofit, such as various foundations, and the Red Cross, etc. “When people think of business careers, they often think of jobs in large wealthy corporations. Many business-related careers, however, exist in small businesses, non-profit organizations, government agencies, and educational settings. Furthermore, you don't need a degree in business to obtain many of these positions. In short, every sector of our economy needs people with strong overall skills that can be applied to business-type careers. There are a wide variety of career areas that exist in business settings.” Wildrosebeef, what is visibility study, , wiki answer, Dec, 23rd, 2011. web.

	<p>One important thing that have to be mentioned is the ways that literacy is used to creat and communicate knowledge in the business field. As is known to all, literacy is a fundamental skill that we have to master to deal with stuffs in our life, the same as in business field. There are three things that are vital important for business discipline. They are writing, reading, and researching. Let us talk about writing first. </p>	
	<p>Writing is the most significant skill of communication. It is one of the most important transferable skills that workers possess. “Most business professionals, such as marketing, finance, and research and development managers, need excellent writing skills to properly convey ideas and concepts. There are many reasons that writing skills are important in the business world.” Suttle, Rick. Importance of writing skills in business. Small business. Houston Chronicle. P1. 8 May. 2008. web. 29 Oct. 2013. <http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-writing-skills-business-845.html>. in the regular companies, bosses need to write emails to notify employees the works they need to push on and other instructions or remind them of some meetings they need to attend. These kind of emails and messages need to be succinct and clear so that the employees can easily understand what they are supposed to do and they will be more efficiently working on their tasks. In addition, a well-written communication also reflect a company’s good image and bring the company creditable reputation. It also shows the significance of writing skills when we focus on the advertisement. If people read an attracting advertisement of the product on internet, newspaper, or magazines, they will be willing to purchase it. This definitely brings more benefit to the company. A good advertisement should be impressive and effective. For example, a company’s advertising brochure should have a headline that attracts reader’s eyeballs and the materials should use some rhetoric such as analogy and metaphor to show the characteristic and advantages of the product. As the competition between the companies increase, more and more technologies are being used to help companies operate internationally. Emails, presentations, reports, materials have took place of telephone communication step by step, which shows the importance of writing skills. Managers in the human resources office need to acquire well-written skills as well. They need to create good recruitment advertising to hire the right people who meet the requirement they post on the advertisement. Therefore, human resources officers must put the right information such as the education and experience and some specific requirement so that the company will not waste the cost and they will appeal the right job applicants. For employees, they should notice the consequence of writing as well. if they do nit write in an appropriate way, troubles will be caused and it might lead to a serious result. “Jokes, profanity, and crude written communications are also prohibited in the workplace.” Suttle, Rick. Importance of writing skills in business. Small business. Houston Chronicle. P1. 8 May. 2008. web. 29 Oct. 2013. <http://smallbusiness.chron.com/importance-writing-skills-business-845.html>. </p>
	<p>Reading is a significant part in business as well, especially in the leadership ability. No one is born to be a leader. Leadership is not a talent but an achievement of consistent effort. People need to learn how to lead themselves first then they will get the ability to become a leader. When it comes to the issue that how can you learn to lead yourself, reading becomes the best solution. Books plays an important role on personal growth and development. Firstly, reading builds people’s self imagines, which helps people to notice how other people feel about you. Whenpeople have higher self imagines, they will expect more from themselves, in this way, they will be more strict to themselves and work harder to achieve the goal. So we need to say, reading makes people continually evaluate their self imagines and encourage people to make progress. Secondly, reading maintains people’s attitude. Attitude is vital to success because it determines how will you deal with problems when you have a hard time. Reading will give you courage and mental toughness. Most books that tells the successful stories can give the readers positive energy and help people get over the hard time, it teaches us a lot. Therefore, reading helps people to avoid failure. Thirdly, reading helps to strengthen the ability to communicate. As we all know, every successful person on this earth must be good at communicating. “The ability to connect with people is of paramount importance if you are looking to be a successful business owner. It is important to note here that people misconstrue having good communication skills to translate into being a good talker and having all the right answers. A good communicator is actually the total reverse. A person with great people skills is actually very skilled at listening.A lot of effective communication is active listening and the ability to help people express themselves and their ideas. Reading will greatly help you to improve your ability to communicate as well as improve your diction and word choice when talking.There are a plethora of books on people skills by Les Giblin, Dale Carnegie and a host of other authors in any major bookstore in the United States.

	<p>Research is another important role in business decision.

You need to research the information of how successful your competitor are and find solutions in time to fill the gaps. Doing research frequently will bring your business a competitive advantage. In addition, the business owners in any companies need to acquire the research skills to constantly review and analysis the market trends and competitive activity. “Trends show you where a market is going and analysis helps you find your place within that market. Look hard at your competitors, work out their strengths and weaknesses and remember you should aim to differentiate yourself clearly from others. This will make marketing easier and helps new customers see the value of giving you a try.” James Bev. Why research is important for your business – the facts are friendly.

	<p>Communication is also another significant technique in business field. Some of the types of interpersonal communication that are commonly used within an organization include staff meetings, formal project discussions, employee performance reviews, and informal chats. Interpersonal communication with those outside of the organization can take a variety of forms as well, including client meetings, employment interviews, or sales visits. In order to understand the principles of effective interpersonal communication, it is helpful to look at the basic process of communication. The information technology plays a significant role in business as well. IT is all about storing, manipulating, distributing and processing information. Over the past few years, IT has replaced the conventional modes of businesses with innovative technological tools. In addition to the increased output and efficiency, IT has introduced new concepts such as e-commerce. In most cases, there are four ways categorizeeffective communication styles. They are “ the listener, the creator, the doer and the thinker. The listener is an effective communicator because he is steady, understands there is more than one way to achieve the same results and is willing to listen to other perspectives. The creator is another effective communicator because he is enthusiastic, creative and skilled in persuasion. The doer is assertive, goal-oriented, verbal and competent in problem-solving. The thinker is analytical, slow to react and contemplative.” Suttle, Rick. Importance of writing skills in business. Small business. Houston Chronicle.

I am lucky to take one of her class and learned a lot from the presentation she gave to us in the class. After having a conversation with her, I knew that to become a member of broad college of business, students need to get prepared from their freshman year. ” freshman have specific things to do every month through the year.” She said. For example, in august, students need to register on My Spartan Career and update the resume. In September, keep checking for opportunities on My Spartan Career. Through out the year, participate in work shop and mock interviews to refine your job search skills. Visit the Lear Center for information about programs and services. Network with potential employers through student organization events especially the accounting student association, beta alpha psi and the national association of black accountants. Additionally, since there are a lot of presentation in the class, a good communication skill is required for both lecturer and students. The lecture needs to be impressive for students so that students can learn things from it. In order to create a good presentation, professor Lynne needs not only convictive materials, but also a creative way to speak. An oral communication skill is vital important at the presentation and it determines whether this lecture is successful or not.</p>

Communications in class also helps professor to know how much the students can learn actually and change the way he teaching in time. We can say that communication helps us to have a more efficient class.</p>
