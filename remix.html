			<h2>REMIX PROJECT ASSESSMENT MEMO</h2>
			<p>After the group meeting and a deep discussion, we decided to use one of our group member’s cultural analysis proposal which talks about the importance of taking risks in our life. Therefore, our documentary has a main issue that the advantages of taking risks far outweigh the disadvantages. In order to prove this point, we collected a lot of examples of the risk takers who have won the success ultimately. In our final documentary, each group member states a point of view and gives an example of the successful story of celebrity who faced the challenges and took risks and achieved the goal at last, which will help the audience to better understand the significance of taking risks. Therefore, our documentary is composed of the main idea and three examples. In this way, we will understand better that life is full of adventure and challenges, only if you dare to take risks can you get the success. 

</p>
            <p>When we were organizing and composing the documentary, we met some problems of choosing the examples. Since at first, we gathered a lot of examples of celebrities, but we only need three of them to convince the audience. It is vital important to choose the best three which prove our statement and show the main ideas throughout the whole story. The examples also need to be popular and easy to understand so that they could grab people’s eyes at once and attract the audience’s interest. The audience needs to keep pace with the point of view which came up with the documentary and think about the topic. It is normal that everyone have their own opinion on the same subject; however, our documentary encourages the audiences to take themselves out of the comfort zone, let them know that taking risks is the only way to succeed in their life. 

</p>
			<p>When we were choosing the topic of our documentary, we reviewed all twelve proposals we wrote earlier and found out that taking risks is the most attractive topic which appeals to people’s eyes at once. Another reason for us to choose this topic is that there are a lot of familiar examples of successful celebrities to use of taking risks. Those examples make it much easier to develop our topic and those examples are easier for the audience to understand. We took the systematic approach when we analysis the examples and the supporting ideas of the topic.</p>
			<p>According to the part of documentary that I was assigned to do, I did research of some example of taking risk leads to success, among which the story of Mark Zuckerberg is the most beneficial one to me. Mark Zuckerberg took one of the biggest risks he could possibly take, dropping out of college a few months after the facebookfounded in 2004. He was a sophomore at Harvard University at the time and majoring in computer science and psychology. He decided to drop out of college just in order to work on the facebook. He also turned down a billion-dollar offer from Yahoo! And that risk made him even wealthier in 2011 and 2012. I think all of the researches I did are beneficial to me and make contribution to the final documentary. </p>
			<p>Our group had a few times of group meetings in two weeks and we set up a discussion group online to follow up every group member’s rate of progress. Every one in our group is assigned to finish a specific part of our documentary and all of our assignments are sent to each other. I enjoyed working with my group. Every group member is responsible for their part and I think group work is fruitful because group work needs collaboration and group member can supervise each other to finish the work in time. Every one has his or her own ideas and discussions can help us select the best ideas for the documentary.

</p>
			<p>I planned my work on this project with our group and I did a lot of research for my part before I began to write draft. I would add more materials and pictures in the documentary if I had more time to do it. I would also improve the quality of the documentary by using more specific quotes. I think the most effective aspect of our documentary’s effectiveness or design is the stories of celebrities. Their success is the most attractive part to the audiences. I made the design decisions when I was doing the research. If you want to convince people and prove your idea, you must have some successful examples and that must be celebrities whom most people admire.
