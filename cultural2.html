Jay fell in love with Daisy when he was a soldier, but they were separated by war. Daisy waited for Jay for a long time but Jay never showed up again. Daisy was depressed and she was forced to marry a wealthy guy called Tom. She decided to give up her love the day she got married. After a few years, Jay Gatsby came back with a mysterious identity who owned millions of property and worked with a lot of high society people. However, the only thing he wanted is to repeat the past. He wanted to be with his lover Daisy. Even though Daisy had got married and she had two kids with Tom, this does not prevent Jay from getting Daisy’s love back.
