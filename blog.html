			<p>the purpose of this video is to tell us the story about televangelist oral robert's gay grandson, and show us his feeling.
			this  video attempts to achieve its purpose by using emotion, telling a personal experience.

			this structure let me know that my lived experiences project need to be more focused on story,and it need to be a little informal and emotional.</p>
			<h1>in class activity2</h1>
			<p>the film “the social network” tells us a story about Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg, who created the facebook and became the youngest billionaire in the history. Mark dropped out of school when he decided to begin his business, but later he was sued by two brothers, Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, who claimed he stole their ideas. The brothers had much better background than Mark, they had better education and their father was wealthy. They may not have good idea about the network, but they were successful in sports. Mark’s best friend, Eduardo Saverin , who gave him a lot support on economy, was cheated by Mark at last. Therefore, personal success is not entirely dependent on formal education and economy, it depends on that person and his ideas and manners. </p>
