			<p>the film “the social network” tells us a story about Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg, who created the facebook and became the youngest billionaire in the history. Mark dropped out of school when he decided to begin his business, but later he was sued by two brothers, Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, who claimed he stole their ideas. The brothers had much better background than Mark, they had better education and their father was wealthy. They may not have good idea about the network, but they were successful in sports. Mark’s best friend, Eduardo Saverin , who gave him a lot support on economy, was cheated by Mark at last. Therefore, personal success is not entirely dependent on formal education and economy, it depends on that person and his ideas and manners. </p>

			<p>in the commercial "Imported from Detroit", there is a deep voiceover throughout the advertisement. at first, it comes up with a question that what does this city know about luxury. what does a town that has been to hell and come back know about the finer things in life. with the change of the frames, the voiceover begins to talk about the well-known saying that "it is the hottest fires that make the hardest steel, add hard work and conviction and the know-how that runs generations deep in every last one of us, that’s who we are, That’s our story." which metaphorically describe the strong technology of motor in detroit and shows the advantages of imported from detroit. "No, its probably not the one you’ve been reading in papers.The one being written by folks who have never even been here and don’t know what we’re capable of. Because when it comes to luxury, it’s as much about where it’s from, as who it’s for.Now, we’re from America, but this isn’t New York City.Or The Windy City. Or Sin City. And we’re certainly no one’s Emerald City.This is the Motor City.And this is what we do." These words shows that detroit is the best city of importing motors. the deep voiceover also gives the audience the feeling that this company is reliable and safe. For the  Inclusion of Eminem/”Lose Yourself”, the company invited the famous rap singer Eminem to be the spokesperson in order to catch audience's eyes and attract more attentions. this advertise strategy makees the product more popular. this commercial also uses the imagery of detroit to let people trust the quality of the product. As is known to us, Detroit is a motor city, so imported in Detroit is a sign of good motor product. This is also a strategy of using people's inertial thinking.
