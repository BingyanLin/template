		<h1>How Technology Helped Me To Choose My Major</h1>
		<p>During my junior and senior year in my high school, I had a really hard time deciding my major in college. I have thought about a lot of questions about myself, such as what I am going to do after I graduate?  what kind of job is suitable for me?  what kind of job can make more money? I was quite confused and melancholy at that period of time during which I went to the college and career office to talk to my advisor every week. When I discussed with my parents and asked for their suggestions, the answer they gave me is no opinion, which surprised me. Since my parents know that I am the kind of person who lacks in the power of decision, so this time, they wanted to let me know that my future depends on my own. After taking everything into consideration, I choose to major in accounting which relates to my interests. Actually, my dreaming job is changing all the time as I grow older. Nevertheless, I believe accounting will be the one that suitable for me the most.</p>
		<p>This can be tracked back to twelve years ago when I first learned math. My mom was a math teacher in elementary school. She began to teach me the numbers and some calculate before I went to school. So it was not surprising that I did well in math, and my math teacher very liked me. However, actually, I was not really interested in math until I got an abacus from my mom. At that time, we cannot use a calculator in school so this abacus became to a helpful tool for me to deal with math problems. It was a brown abacus in a rectangular shape; it was kind of old and big to me, but I just felt I like it. At first, I had no idea how to use it, but I liked to play with the little balls on it. My mom told me it was a gift which my grandmother bought to her when my mom got her first job. In China, it is a traditional tool which can be used to calculate. We called it “suan pan”. It is quite convenient and makes the calculate simple to do. Just move some balls and the answer will come up clearly. After my mom taught me how to use it, I showed it to some of my friends, and I found myself was attracted to math. I loved to calculate. Abacus was the first piece of technology that led me to choose accounting major.</p>
		<P>As I went to middle school, I began to learn math in a higher level, I do not need the abacus anymore because I already improved my calculate skills after the long-time practice. My teacher always said I can do faster and better than other students in calculate; I think it was all owing to my abacus, without which I would feel bored about math like some other students did, and I would not do well in math. in the middle school, every one in class was asked to buy a scientific calculator which could be used to do some complex formulas. That was when I got a Casio calculator which followed me three years during middle school. This calculator was easy to operate, and it did help a lot in math class. As the math levels increased, I was more likely to deal with those challenges, and I felt so successful every time I got the answer even if it was hard. Since I did not use my abacus any more, I kept it well at home. With the courage it brought to me, I never felt frustrated in math. I liked math and I believed that I could do well. When I learned calculus in high school, I got a bigger calculator which could do graphing, algebra, and most kinds of calculus as well. It attracted me at the first time I used it to graph the function; it was amazing, and it made me feel like math was just like magic, it could transfer numbers to functions, and transfer functions to graphs. I can say that math is my favorite class, and abacus was my first teacher who made me love math while the calculator helped me develop in math.</P>
		<P>As I looked into all the information about majors in college, accounting became the first preferred choice which was related to calculation and could make money as well. According to the research, The accounting major at Michigan State University was in top 20 in America. Although it is difficult to get into business college and graduate for the accounting major students, I believe I can do it well with strong calculate skills. In my impression, people who work in the large company are always graduated from business college. And I whish to become a white-collar working in the big company, wearing suit and high heels, communicating with different clients and dealing with business, that is the life what I had seen in the movie and what I dreamed of.

		<P>In the textbook, it said “Accounting is a service-based profession that provides reliable and relevant financial information useful in making decisions.” Accounting is not as simple as calculate, it is not only about math. It has a lot of new staff for me to learn, and there are some certifications to get passed. Accounting has different branches, such as financial accounting, management accounting, cost accounting, statistic, taxation, audit, among which I prefer to do statistic or audit. Further more, if I get a job and get promotion, I will learn management. My cousin told me it would be easy to get a job, but it may take many years to get promotion because of the experience, so I will work really hard like when I deal with the math problems at school. Accounting is not like computer science; the skills are not changing as time goes by. Accounting plays an important role in all companies, even in the whole country. It records the income, spending,performs the internal audit; it is a process to deal with financial information. Accounting provides information of the economic resources to the company, the model of finance changing, the result of achievement through the use. In brief, accounting is the management of money, which can be the heart of a firm.</P>
		<P>In the old times, people used the abacus to keep accounts. However, with the development of science and technology, there are a lot of software designed for economics and can be used to records, to identify, to communicate and calculate the profit and lose. I have much to learn and a lot to do. I believe when I deal with accounting using these newest devices and software in the future, I will think of my abacus, and I will always remember what it has brought to me. It will be always important to me and bring me confidence. My experience of mathematics has helped me to find my interests and helped me to choose major. Life may be shaped as a result of some little things. Anyway, abacus has shaped my career path. No matter how hard it is going to be, I will go for it. </P>
