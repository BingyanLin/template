			<p>Firstly, it is a commom phenomenon that most people's wages have not risen while the prices have, which results to the decline of people’s life quality. With the increase of the prices, people have to pull back on their spending and make more money. This is one of the reasons why money plays an more and more important role in society. Therefore, the government should extende their reach, they should take measures in increasing subsidies, fixing prices, banning exports of key commodities. When the price of food goes up too high, the government should set up the policy of price ceiling or price floor in time to prevent the bigger trouble ithat it may bring to the society. As for the house price, the government should control the price and ensure housing affordability and housing price stability. It is the government’s responsibility and obligation to provide houses to citizens, not the way to make money. If the government do the price control well, it will not be a problem for people that are not wealthy enough, and it might change the idea that money is everything. When the economy in the society runs well, there is no need to be crazy for money. True happiness comes when we learn to be content with what we have.
