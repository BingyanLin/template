			<p>Secondly, education plays an important role to change people’s idea about money. There are two ways to solve this social issue in education. The first one is that we should require a course in school to help students to set up the correct values of money. Students need to be guide to correct opinions before they get involved to the society. As we all know, the disconnection in the education between society, school and family is the main reason to cause the wrong values and thought among people.  Therefore, in this repuired class, students should be taught about the economic phenomenon in the society and the value of money. Money can buy the house, but it cannot buy the home; money can buy the medicine, but it cannot buy the health; money can buy the food, but it cannot buy the appetite. Money can buy the partner, but it cannot buy the friend. Money is not everything, it is just a tool to keep the economy in balance and keep the society running. There is much more things in our life that is more important than money like happiness and love. Money cannot buy happiness and love because they are people’s feeling. In the novel The Great Gatsby, Love gives Jay Gatsby the motivation to get a large fortue and become a young millionaire, but he is not able to buy Daisy’s love at last. He is cheated by love, or we can say he is cheated by his wishful thoughts. Daisy has changed but Jay still lives in the old memory, that is the reason why he believe Daisy would come back to him when he becomes wealthy. 
money cannot buy true love. Someone may be attracted by you because of your wealth, but it is never going to be true love. On the other hand, people make money because of love. They love their family so they want to creat better living conditions for them. Happiness is also more important than money. people are more willing to work hard with their lover than possess a fortune alone because the frontier can bring happiness to them which cannot be bought by money. money will disappear one day when people die but love will always exist in the mind. Love is the dominate of the world, rather than money. We can also set up some presentations for the students and ask them to do some survey about the values of money, in this way, we can correct their opinions and change people’s mind little by little.
