			<p>Thirdly, the society should appeal for charity. In this way, wealthy people will make generous response to the appeals for funds. And money will be used on the people who need help and things that deserved to use more money on. It is not only a good way to narrow the gap between the rich and poor, but also a way to change people’s opinion of wealth. The rich people are willing to donate money to charity because it shows their kindness. If the movie stars begin to get involved in the charity, the media will report and praise this kind of behavior, and it will cause a big social effect. People will not put money in the things that is not necessary for them, they will be more willing to get involved in charity which can show their kindness and generosity. Money will become a tool to help others, not the way to make benefits. Charity will increase people’s happiness because they help each other. It will also create a peaceful society that money will not mean everything. People will build a new value of money in their mind. Also the government should encourage this kind of behavior by give some honor to the people who make efforts to the charity. In this way, people’s life will become substantial and meaningful. </p>
