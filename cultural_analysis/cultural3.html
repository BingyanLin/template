			<p>We have to say it is a sad story, Gatsby is a poor guy who struggled in the high society and dead with his dream unfinished. Daisy did not choose Gatsby because he did not have enough economic strength and family background. She gave up her happiness because she was afraid of gossip. The  relationship and love between people is so fragile and pale in front of utility and fame. The Great Gatsby reveals the disintegration of the American dream in the era of prosperity and material and it also draws people’s attention on the relationship between money and love. With the rapid development of commodity economy, people’s awareness of money are gradually strengthened.  We have seen a lot of examples in our life. The property notarization before marriage among the couples; members of a family keep careful accounts by themselves; brothers fight for how to divide up the estate; everyone pays for the bill in the party. People’s attention to money has become an increasingly common social phenomenon. The relationships between people have become subordinated to the needs of the financial relationship. Social relations between people show the relationship between money more and more specifically and directly. Is this phenomenon a kind of progress in the field of social consciousness? Or a step of Retrogression? How can we solve this social issue?In my opinion, the problem about money in our society beeds to be solved by both government and citizens.
